Privacy Policy for Bodhisattva Translate

Effective Date: 2025-02-25

Introduction

Thank you for using Bodhisattva Translate (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.

Information We Collect

The Extension's core function is to translate text on web pages using an AI Large Language Model (LLM). To achieve this, the Extension collects the following data:

Text to be translated: When you use the Extension to translate text, we collect the text you have selected for translation.

How We Use Your Information

The text you select for translation is sent via an API to our secure translation server. Our server, in turn, forwards this text to the AI LLM for processing.

Important: We want to assure you that our API server does not store the text you submit for translation. The server's sole purpose is to facilitate the translation process by acting as an intermediary between the Extension and the AI LLM.

Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be clear about what we do not collect:

Personal information: We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or browsing history.
Website data: Aside from the specific text you select for translation, we do not collect any other data from the websites you visit.
Information Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties, except as required by law or to comply with a legal process.

Data Security

We are committed to protecting the security of your data. We use industry-standard security measures to safeguard the information transmitted between the Extension, our server, and the AI LLM.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Effective Date."

Data Minimization: Clearly state that you only collect the minimum data necessary for the Extension's functionality.
No Storage of Translated Text: Reiterate that the API server does not store the translated text.
Focus on Translation Process: Explain that the data is solely used for the translation process and nothing else.
